This is a CNN-LSTM code that is mainly used to perform the task of classifying EEG data based on motor imagery of sign language.
This is a piece of supervised learning code. You need to label each epoch as you collect data for subsequent classification tasks.
This code can currently perform four categorical tasks.
If you want to use this code to complete the classification, just import your EEG data. If you have better ideas, feel free to make changes and improvements to the code.
